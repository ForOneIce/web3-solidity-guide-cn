# Smart Calculator

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a simple calculator in Solidity. You want it to handle basic math ‚Äî addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Things are smooth until a user says:

> ‚ÄúHey, can this also calculate square roots? Or raise numbers to powers?‚Äù
> 

You could throw everything into one huge contract...

But there's a better approach: **split responsibilities**.

One contract will handle the basics.

Another contract will handle advanced stuff ‚Äî like powers and square roots.

Then, we‚Äôll make them **talk to each other**.

Let‚Äôs build this step by step.

## The Plan: Two Contracts, Two Files

We‚Äôre going to build **two smart contracts** that work together:

1. **`Calculator.sol`** ‚Äì This will be our main calculator. It handles basic math like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When it needs help with more advanced math, it delegates the task.
2. **`ScientificCalculator.sol`** ‚Äì This contract is where we‚Äôll put the advanced stuff ‚Äî like exponentiation (powers) and square root calculations.

Each contract will live in its **own separate file**, but they‚Äôll be connected.

</aside>

In order to call functions from `ScientificCalculator` inside the `Calculator` contract, we‚Äôll **import** it and store its deployed address.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Keep both files in the same directory, so the import works without issues.
>

## What Do These Files Look Like?

Before we dive into writing the logic, here‚Äôs what the basic structure ‚Äî or "shell" ‚Äî of each file looks like:

### File 1: `ScientificCalculator.sol`

```solidity
 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ScientificCalculator {
    // advanced functions will go here
}

```

This file defines the contract that handles powers and square roots ‚Äî all the math that goes beyond the basics.

---

### File 2: `Calculator.sol`

```solidity
 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ScientificCalculator.sol";

contract Calculator {
    // basic math functions}

```

This file defines the main `Calculator` contract. It includes:

- Basic arithmetic functions

With the structure in place, let‚Äôs now move into the `ScientificCalculator` and start building it out, one function at a time.

## ScientificCalculator ‚Äì Starting with Advanced Math

We‚Äôll begin with the contract that handles the advanced operations ‚Äî `ScientificCalculator`.

Here‚Äôs the very first part of the file:

```solidity
 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```

These are the standard declarations at the top of every Solidity file. They make sure your contract compiles properly and is legally usable.

Now let‚Äôs define our contract:

```solidity
 
contract ScientificCalculator {

```

We‚Äôre creating a new contract named `ScientificCalculator`. Inside this, we‚Äôll start by writing a function to calculate powers.

---

### power(base, exponent)

```solidity
 
function power(uint256 base, uint256 exponent) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (exponent == 0) return 1;
    else return (base ** exponent);
}

```

This function returns the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent`.

- If the exponent is 0, it returns 1 ‚Äî that‚Äôs just standard math.
- Otherwise, it uses Solidity‚Äôs `*` operator to calculate `base` to the power of `exponent`.
- It‚Äôs marked `pure` because it doesn‚Äôt read or change anything on the blockchain. It just does math.

Next, we‚Äôll add a function to estimate square roots.

---

### squareRoot(number)

```solidity
 
function squareRoot(uint256 number) public pure returns (uint256) {
    require(number >= 0, "Cannot calculate square root of negative number");
    if (number == 0) return 0;

    int256 result = number / 2;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        result = (result + number / result) / 2;
    }
    return result;
}

```

This function estimates the square root of a number using a classic technique called **Newton‚Äôs Method** ‚Äî a smart way to find square roots through repeated approximations.

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

- First, we check if the input number is negative using `require`. Solidity doesn‚Äôt support complex numbers, so square roots of negatives are off-limits.
- Then we handle a quick edge case: if the number is 0, the square root is also 0 ‚Äî so we return that right away.
- Now comes the actual approximation. We start with a **rough guess** by dividing the number in half:
    
    `uint256 result = number / 2;`
    
- We then **refine that guess 10 times** using a simple formula:
    
    `(result + number / result) / 2`
    
    This formula works by combining the current guess with what we‚Äôd get if the guess were perfect ‚Äî and averaging them. Each loop brings us closer to the actual square root.
    

Even though we‚Äôre not using floating-point math, this method still gives a pretty decent estimate for whole numbers ‚Äî good enough for many practical use cases in Solidity.

## Calculator ‚Äì The Main Math Engine (Plus Some Help)

This contract handles the basic math: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers. But when things get more advanced ‚Äî like calculating powers or square roots ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt do everything on its own.

Instead, it reaches out to the `ScientificCalculator` contract for help.

Let‚Äôs start from the top of the file:

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ScientificCalculator.sol";

```

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

We‚Äôre using an `import` statement to bring the code from `ScientificCalculator.sol` into this file. This allows the `Calculator` contract to **use functions from that other contract**.

The `"./"` part tells Solidity:

> ‚ÄúLook in the same directory (or folder) as this file and find ScientificCalculator.sol.‚Äù
> 

So for this import to work properly, both files ‚Äî `Calculator.sol` and `ScientificCalculator.sol` ‚Äî **must be saved in the same folder**.

This setup is what allows one contract to know about and interact with the other.

Now, let‚Äôs start building the rest of the `Calculator` contract. We‚Äôll begin by declaring the contract itself and setting up a few important variables.

Now, we declare the contract:

```solidity
 
contract Calculator {

```

Inside the contract, let‚Äôs define a few **state variables** to store useful information.

---

### State Variables

```solidity
 
address public owner;
address public scientificCalculatorAddress;

```

- `owner` will store the address that deployed this contract.
- `scientificCalculatorAddress` is where we‚Äôll store the address of the already-deployed `ScientificCalculator`.

Now, let‚Äôs set the owner during deployment.

---

### constructor()

```solidity
 
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}

```

When someone deploys this contract, their address is stored as the `owner`.

We‚Äôll use that later to restrict certain functions.

---

### onlyOwner Modifier

```solidity
 
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can perform this action");
    _;
}

```

This is a **modifier**, which is like a reusable gatekeeper.

Any function using `onlyOwner` can only be called by the original deployer of the contract.

Let‚Äôs use it now to allow the owner to link a ScientificCalculator.

---

### setScientificCalculator(address)

```solidity
 
function setScientificCalculator(address _address) public onlyOwner {
    scientificCalculatorAddress = _address;
}

```

Once your ScientificCalculator contract is deployed, you can copy its address and pass it here. This function saves that address so we can call its functions later.

---

## Basic Math Functions

Let‚Äôs now define some basic arithmetic operations. These are all `pure` functions ‚Äî they don‚Äôt touch the blockchain state and just return results.

---

### add(a, b)

```solidity
 
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 result = a + b;
    return result;
}

```

Simple addition. Takes two numbers and returns the sum.

---

### subtract(a, b)

```solidity
 
function subtract(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 result = a - b;
    return result;
}

```

Subtracts `b` from `a` and returns the result.

---

### multiply(a, b)

```solidity
 
function multiply(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 result = a * b;
    return result;
}

```

Multiplies the two numbers together.

---

### divide(a, b)

```solidity
 
function divide(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    require(b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero");
    uint256 result = a / b;
    return result;
}

```

Divides `a` by `b`. But before doing that, it checks if `b` is zero ‚Äî just to avoid errors.

---

## Connecting to Another Contract: Power Function

Now here‚Äôs where things get really interesting ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to make one smart contract **talk to another**.

Let‚Äôs say the user wants to calculate something like `5 to the power of 3`. The basic `Calculator` contract doesn‚Äôt know how to do that ‚Äî but the `ScientificCalculator` does.

Instead of re-writing that logic again, we‚Äôll **call the `power()` function from the other contract** and return the result.

---

### `calculatePower(base, exponent)`

```solidity

function calculatePower(uint256 base, uint256 exponent) public view returns (uint256) {
    ScientificCalculator scientificCalc = ScientificCalculator(scientificCalculatorAddress);
    uint256 result = scientificCalc.power(base, exponent);
    return result;
}

```

Let‚Äôs break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Address Casting

```solidity

ScientificCalculator scientificCalc = ScientificCalculator(scientificCalculatorAddress);

```

This line is doing something really important. It‚Äôs taking a plain Ethereum address (`scientificCalculatorAddress`) and **casting** it into a usable contract object ‚Äî in this case, a `ScientificCalculator`.

You can think of it like this:

> ‚ÄúSolidity, here‚Äôs an address on the blockchain. I know it points to a ScientificCalculator contract. Please treat it like one so I can call its functions.‚Äù
> 

This process is called **address casting** ‚Äî you‚Äôre converting an address into a contract reference so you can interact with it directly.

And this works **only because we‚Äôve already imported `ScientificCalculator.sol`** at the top of the file. Solidity now knows the structureof that contract, so it allows us to call its functions safely.

---

### Step 2: Calling the Function

```solidity
uint256 result = scientificCalc.power(base, exponent);

```

Now that we have a contract reference, calling a function on it is as simple as using dot notation ‚Äî just like calling a method in any object-oriented programming language.

This sends a read-only call to the deployed `ScientificCalculator` contract, asking it to compute `base ** exponent`, and then returns the result.

---

### Step 3: Returning the Result

```solidity
return result;

```

We simply return the value so the user gets the answer to their calculation.

---

### Why This Approach Works

This is the **high-level, type-safe** way to call another contract:

- It‚Äôs easy to read and write
- It requires that you‚Äôve imported the external contract's code
- It lets the compiler catch mistakes ‚Äî like calling a non-existent function

This is the recommended approach when you **know the structure of the other contract** and have access to its source code.

---

## Bonus: Using Low-Level Calls

Sometimes, you want to interact with another contract **without importing its source code** ‚Äî maybe you only know the address and the name of the function you want to call.

In those cases, you can use a **low-level call**. It‚Äôs more flexible but also riskier because Solidity can‚Äôt protect you from mistakes at compile time.

Let‚Äôs see how this works in practice by calling the `squareRoot()` function from the `ScientificCalculator` contract **without using a direct import**.

---

### `calculateSquareRoot(number)`

```solidity

function calculateSquareRoot(uint256 number) public returns (uint256) {
    require(number >= 0, "Cannot calculate square root of negative number");

    bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("squareRoot(int256)", number);
    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = scientificCalculatorAddress.call(data);
    require(success, "External call failed");

    uint256 result = abi.decode(returnData, (uint256));
    return result;
}

```

---

Let‚Äôs walk through this line by line.

---

### Step 1: Input Validation

```solidity

require(number >= 0, "Cannot calculate square root of negative number");

```

We start by making sure the number is not negative. Solidity doesn‚Äôt support imaginary numbers, so we reject negative inputs up front.

---

### Step 2: Encode the Function Call

```solidity

bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("squareRoot(int256)", number);

```

This is the **heart of the low-level call**. We use something called the **ABI** to prepare the function call.

### What is ABI?

ABI stands for **Application Binary Interface**. Think of it as a contract‚Äôs "communication protocol" ‚Äî it defines how data must be structured when one contract calls another.

When using high-level function calls (like `otherContract.someFunction()`), Solidity handles ABI encoding for you. But with low-level calls, **you must do it manually**.

---

### What does `abi.encodeWithSignature` do?

It builds the exact binary format the EVM expects when calling a specific function.

In this case:

```solidity

abi.encodeWithSignature("squareRoot(int256)", number)
```

- `"squareRoot(int256)"` is the full function signature (name + parameter types).
- `number` is the value we're passing as an argument.
- The result is a byte array (`bytes memory`) that contains everything needed to call that function on the blockchain.

---

### Step 3: Make the Low-Level Call

```solidity

(bool success, bytes memory returnData) = scientificCalculatorAddress.call(data);
```

Here, we‚Äôre telling the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):

> ‚ÄúHey, send a raw call to this address, using the encoded data we just created.‚Äù
> 
- `.call(data)` sends that data to the address stored in `scientificCalculatorAddress`.
- It returns two things:
    - `success` (a boolean that tells us if the call worked)
    - `returnData` (a byte array that holds whatever the function returned)

> üîß This is like calling a function manually through the back door ‚Äî you need to get everything exactly right.
> 

---

### Step 4: Check if the Call Succeeded

```solidity

require(success, "External call failed");

```

Always check if the call worked. If something went wrong (wrong signature, wrong address, function not found, etc.), `success` will be false ‚Äî and we stop execution with a helpful error message.

---

### Step 5: Decode the Response

```solidity

uint256 result = abi.decode(returnData, (uint256));

```

Now we take the raw return data and decode it back into a usable value ‚Äî in this case, a `uint256`.

Since we know the return type of `squareRoot()` is `int256` (and we're returning it as `uint256` here), you might choose to adjust this depending on how you handle signed values. For simplicity, we assume the number passed in is safe and positive.

---

### Step 6: Return the Final Result

```solidity
return result;

```

Finally, we return the result of the square root calculation to whoever called this function.

---

## Recap

By now, you‚Äôve built two contracts that:

- Divide logic between basic and advanced math
- Talk to each other using both **high-level calls** and **low-level calls**
- Show how to **modularize logic** and keep things organized
- Demonstrate safe practices like access control and error checking

These are essential patterns for building real-world decentralized applications that are clean, maintainable, and scalable.
